Feature classes contain the map information like points for locations, shapes for areas and lines for roads. Feature datasets keep related feature classes together and keep them on the same coordinate system so everything lines up. This keeps things organized to make mapping less confusing. The relationship between them is like a Russian nesting doll. Each layer gets smaller adding a new level of organization and detail. The structure of this relationship is key and really simplifies ArcGIS once you understand it.\n"
